# LLM-Full-Stack-Tutorial
A trail full stack application of an LLM web scraping app. 🕸️ 🍴

This is a tutorial which is still under construction.\
Here I am trying to implement a full stack LLM application which was implemented by another author.\
The tutorial is one of the repos of https://github.com/ashnkumar. 🧔
#### I take this opportunity to credit Ashwin, the owner of this implementation. I am just trying to debug it and build on it. 🐛

Right now the implementation is being debugged.\
Currently the application renders LLM and embedding from OpenAI and uses Pinecone as its vector database. 🌰 ❇️

The backend is developed using Flask 🧴, frontend using Node.js 💻 and RESTful APIs 🛌.

Basically what I will be intending to do is try and invoke LangChain.🦜️🔗\
Along with that I will try to substitute some latest components such as Weaviate 🧶, FastAPI ⏩, Langchain.js ⛓️, etc, to try simplify the frontend and backend processes.\
In doing so, I intend to make a LLM app develop easier for a Machine Learning Engineer who has less exposure to frontend and backend development 🧠.
